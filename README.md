# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
Prediction of employee attrition of organization using machine learning algorithms.
Implemented data preprocessing techniques for making the data insights useful. 
Data in given data set wsa imbalance so sampling techniques like oversampling, undersampling and SMOTE is applied to make data balance 
Build various classification algorithms like logistic regression, KNN, SVM, DT, RF algorithms on balanced data  and check accuray of all the models.
